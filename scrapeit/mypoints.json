Mypoints system can't and many receipts that are instantly accepted on other sites and list the item you are trying to get credit for, will go under review for up to 4 days.

I don't have a cell phone or non-VOIP phone number.  I contacted MyPoints May 28, 2022, about this.  The response was to wait for an email about getting verified.  I got that next email and followed instructions for downloading ID and had my face scanned.  I was told to then wait for another email--they said it could take a while.  After quite a while without hearing from anyone, I contacted MyPoints again; I then received an email for going through the verification process again (ID, face scan).  Then I got an email saying I can now get gift cards without the cell phone requirement.  I needed 3 cards in 3 different amounts; after getting the first 2 cards, it wouldn't let me get the 3rd because I was over the limit for the day.  IT DIDN\"T SAY WHAT KIND OF LIMIT--maybe a dollar limit, maybe a number of cards limit?  The next day, I got the 3rd card.  Luckily, the place where I'd made the purchase May 30 let me use the gift cards today (8-3-2022 was when I got the 3rd card; I got the cards as soon as I could after getting word of being verified), and they took that amount off my credit card I used on May 30.  The item was a clearance item; if they hadn't let me wait to redeem gift cards and if I therefore waited to buy, I may have been out of luck for the reduced price even if the item was still in stock.

The promotions and To do list spots don\u2019t cover correctly. Many of the items on the Magic Receipts don\u2019t credit. I am always showing proof that I didn\u2019t get credit for things, and I generally get the credit after submitting a form, but the form is difficult to find. It\u2019s hard to submit through the ledger because they won\u2019t allow you to use the ledger for 2-7 days when you have to have the credit immediately to get the points through the promotion!

Some days I may try up to 40 surveys to get one.  Of course, they do not show up in the visited section.  It was great to have videos to pick up those extra points one needs to hit that bump to get your goal  Now they are gone.

Too many times, I have to open a ticket for later awarding surveys. ", "rating": "Rated 2 out of 5 stars"},

I repeatedly told them that printing was not the problem and that I had no problem printing but I just was was not getting the credit for printing.  I even submitted pictures of the coupons I printed. Again the canned response several times was how to print coupons.  After I requested that the ticket be elevated, I was told they could not help when I asked for a contact at coupons.com and refused to answer any further correspondence.   I managed to figure out the problem myself  but someone at MyPoints or coupons.com or the vender who handles the coupons would have to fix the issue.  And guess what, it has nothing to do with the inability to print.  I would explain here was the problem is but MyPoints really couldn\u2019t not care less and I have since found another way to get credit for coupons.

They have no clue about how the panel works and they don't see how they get screwed. The panel is only creative on how to make more money while keeping the incentives ridiculously low for many surveys, which very often end at 60-70% completion. Days long studies, like beverages diaries, disappear from the ledger/dashboard out of nowhere half completed and unpaid. The videos you watch, can go offline and miss the streak that gets you the points. They haven't fixed that in a decade. You can never check on tickets' status. They have disabled that panel. They only respond to like 10% of your tickets and oftentimes, a month late and only to those requests they don't have to pay anything to begin with. They don't allow pdf format for receipts and the email they give you to send them to verify manually if you have an issue, they never check it. Costco for example, is now storing in-store receipts as a PDF in your online account but the MyPoints system only accepts images. As far as crediting for surveys that you report with a problem, that, never happens. They want you to confirm via email that what you report is correct before they even look at, so they buy time and have a chance to do nothing if you don't reply. I have been a member for over 10 years and my experience is very mixed. I have a feeling that they believe, people are naive and can't figure out what they do to them. They seem to be affiliated with InboxDollars who scammed me out of 75 dollars because a 72-year-old family member who was also a member, took a few surveys during vacation in Europe.

At first I thought it was from my cats walking on my keyboard as some of the surveys would auto advance on their own. So I figured it was that. They were nice and would re-activate. This happed so many times, I finally would not let my cats in the room while doing surveys. Then this last time, I got the dreaded..Why surveys are not for me. I could not figure out why as the cats didn't walk on keyboard and I was so careful. So submitted a ticket. Got the canned reply, but the girl re-activated. I went to do a survey, only answered one question. Was I a male or Female. I clicked male and right away got the \"Why surveys are not for me\" So I still had the ticket email and went back and repied to it saying I only clicked on male and got the Why Surveys are not for me. I got the canned reply from this ticket girl and went back and it allowed me to finish the surveys that day. The next day, it did the same thing. one question and Boom, Why surveys are not for me. That was when the light bulb went off in my head. When they re-activate your surveys, they must click a program that tells the system to kick you out, in a week, month, day, but it is definitely programed in. So either the program has a bug in it or the ticket girl is just clicking 1 day and then deactivate. I sent another reply to the same ticket girl saying I have gotten the message. Meaning I have figured out their lying system. I'm an old man, and they must want younger people who buy things all the time through their site. I don't buy much or buy from non of their merchants.

So I started a ticket to tell them I think there was a lag in them sending me the PIN number and now it won't let me earn some points through the email and it won't let me redeem my points about 60.00 worth. Then I get a reply email in 10 days saying they want a Government I.D sent in. If they wanted a Passport or DL they need to do that when people sign up. I am not going to send them that info. They try to say it's a secure site, etc gives me 2 days to submit. I am just going to close my account. If they ask me why I'll tell them I think they purposely delayed sending that PIN number to my cell phone, I think they don't want older people doing their website. We don't buy enough. Who knows. I've heard a lot of bad things. I didn't even make it 6 months. and it is not my fault it took 10 minutes for their PIN number to get to my phone. I told them I didn't change my password, address, or cell phone number.

I've been with the program now for around 10 years. Surveys are a necessity if you want to earn points in any reasonable amount of time. That being said he can be difficult sometimes to qualify for a survey, and also many times I found technical flaws and errors on surveys that prevent  getting points. Mypoints makes it very difficult to file a trouble ticket. It's a very cumbersome process and even when you finally do get the ticket filed often they will send you back an email asking for information that was already provided on the ticket. In other words it appears that they are making it difficult purposely to discourage submitting tickets. Sadly this is usually successful because trying to leap over the various hurdles isn't worth the effort and usually I just give up and try another survey. On a positive note, Mypoints provides other options to earn small point levels. It's very easy to spend way too much time this way though, so you have to develop a strategy so it doesn't become another day job. If Mypoints would be more customer-focused to help members who experience survey problems it would be a really great program.", "rating": "Rated 4 out of 5 stars"},

I had approx 63,000 points when this all started,  Knowing my email would end the first of February, my plan was to use the points on gift cards by February 1st.  I received a $50.00card from Olive Garden which for some reason I cant load on Google Pay. j jMaybe the code is wrong.  Another gifr card for Olive Garden for $25.00 I never received.

Until recently I had no real problems using the site or getting customer service.  I guess recently they changed policy on redeeming points and require people to receive a text to verify before submitting for gift cards. For those who don't own a cellphone (I know; go figure in this day and age, but what are you gonna do) that is an impossible task. The next option for verification I was offered was sending in a photo of my ID to verify who I was, which of course, is also not possible unless you have a mobile phone, not to mention MyPoints doesn't need my photo ID since they have never known what I look like since I started using their website.  I had to send several emails explaining this problem to customer service.  Every time I did, I got the same customer service person answering my ticket who would alternate between telling me to send in the photo of my ID to verify, even though I had explained in my ticket that I was unable to do so, and giving me non answers that had nothing whatsoever to do with the problem I was experiencing.  I got this same person again after what was planned to be my last ditch effort to get this resolved before I would be forced to delete my account with MyPoints.  Because, obviously, I was going to be unable to use the site as intended going forward.  I got another non answer, which I answered sarcastically.  After all, I was stuck between a rock and a hard place at this point and didn't expect a whole lot.  After that reply from me, I finally got a different customer service rep who actually resolved the issue.  I think it is a shame that it took me so many months and emails to get a real answer from someone there.

I don't care for any of the newer cash back entities like Honey or Rakuten.  I've been loyal to my points for over 10 years now.  The main reason I joined ironically was to take surveys.  I loved taking online surveys, but I have used them for purchases as well.  However, on two occasions I was suspended from taking surveys for supposedly providing \"incorrect or inconsistent\" responses.  This most recent time I have been suspended for over a year now.  It's frustrating because if you make one wrong mistake with your birthdate, age, sex, etc in a survey that affects your standing overall.  It's like they expect complete perfection.  And I've belonged to other survey sites for years, made mistakes, because I'm only human, and still am allowed to take them. So I don't make as much now.  I don't earn as many points.  Which is frustrating. and I don't buy as much online anymore as well so I was hoping more free offers would be available. But they've been offering gradually less and less over the years.  IT's definitely going downhill. But I'm not ready to switch over completely to another site.", "rating": "Rated 3 out of 5 stars"},

It almost seems as though you are intentionally making the experience horrible so people will just give up. Please go back to the drawing board with you receipt process. Your computer system needs to pick up more rebates when initially submitted and when under review, the review time needs to be drastically improved because it takes too long.

MyPoints said they have no way of confirming the completion.  Today I had the same thing happen with a survey so I submitted a request again.

Sometimes they don\u2019t answer back to you after months! But now for the positive parts, this service is very  rewarding and has many ways for you to be rewarded. From watching, taking part in surveys, magic receipts, and even making a fair amount of points if you spend a certain amount on an online order (mainly for the desktop version) and a lot more!

Originally, those surveys with an \"!\" after the survey number, DID NOT earn you the normal 5 points. However lately regular surveys have also not been providing the 5 points for trying. In the passed, you rec'd a set number of points for your monthly searches, now it's a hit or a miss if you earn any bonus search points and I quite confidently will say IF you get those bonus search points, they certainly will not add up to the previous credits for searching.

You earn rewards points for doing things like clicking through emails and shopping online, and occasionally in store through barcodes scanned at the register. In the first few years, you could earn rewards fairly quickly with very little effort, just click through all the emails and occasionally by something. Within a few months, you could redeem points for a $50 gift card. But a few years in the changed the exchange rate of points from 100 points per dollar, until ultimately it became 158 points per dollar. It's still a good program, but there are very few click thru emails that generate points any more, so unless you buy something, you'll be years earning enough for gift cards.

{"title": "It's hard to overly criticize a system\u2026", "date": "2021-07-28T14:08:17.000Z", "body": "It's hard to overly criticize a system that pays rewards but even though mypoints is better than some it still has problems: 1. I don't fully know the criteria u use but some other users are dismayed when they are disqualified from doing surveys. Without that service it is hard to meet daily quotas you set. I understand that survey companies want good answers but my experience is that leading, biased & poorly constructed questions, plus not allowing for all reasonable answers invite conscious survey-takers to have to choose the least bad answer. If that provides inconsistent answers it's the survey company's fault but i understand you have to 'go' with them. I get it but it sucks... they are paying you for this. 2. occasionally coupons won't accept my tel# for verification. It sometimes takes weeks to fix this.You never help & coupons.com takes a long time to get their good CSRs working on it. From the suggestions I get in your replies, it's apparent, the responder never read my message beyond the subject line. 3. inconsistent video playback often causes the stream to hang (red banner)at the end but it's not consistent. In particular 'the wobble' and 'crackle' & occasionally 'telemundo' all hang up frequently at the end of the video & require different actions to get to the next. one.  Often while I'm trying to restart it, you send a message criticizing me for going too fast that takes add'l action to get past. 4. magic coupons frequently cant approve an item on uploaded receipts. for example: 'bulk oranges' not recognized as 'oranges', 'italian loaf' not recognized as 'bread', 'ragu' not recognized as 'pasta sauce'. every time i've asked for review, its been approved but sometimes i need the points that day to meet my quota you've established & I have to work harder & use other resources to meet the quota.  you need to make the coupon recognition software smarter. Now, its really dumb. 5. Sometimes it takes 3-5 days to get credit for printing coupons. I try to stagger the crediting to help with meeting the daily quota. When you delay crediting the points for so long & then everything gets credited the same day, it's hard to meet the quota & wastes the points I've accumulated by other means. I use a lot of coupons but I can't possibly use all the coupons offered so i have to try to space out the useful ones because of the daily quota. 6.Too often you change how things work which irritates us.  You've changed the format/layout/operation of 'Magic Receipts' 3 or 4 times in the short time it's been available.  It started out simple; now it's complicated. a couple new features are nice but please Don't fix what's not broken & leave the format as it is.  We don't want to have to learn new ways to do the same old stuff every couple weeks. 7. If you've disqualified a user from surveys yoy still invite them to use features that require surveys to complete.  do you know how irritating that is when you're sure you tried the very best you can to answer the surveys right but got disqualified because the survey companies wrote poor questions, provided a poor selection of answers or didn't like our religious or political view or your age? I understand it's their system & that they call the shots but you don't have to keep inviting us to features we can't do because you prevent us from completing the tasks.", "rating": "Rated 2 out of 5 stars"},
